# User Story Generator

# How To Use....

## Break your app into features
**Example:**
If the app is a messaging app where you can make a profile and message other users
Feature One: Profile
Feature Two: Messages

### Think about the possible questions for that feature


Lets take Profiles

> Can users view other user's profiles?
> What information is viewable to other user's?
> What information is stored for each user? 
> Can you upload a user photo?
> Can you upload several user photos?
> Can a user delete their profile?


Answer those Questions!
